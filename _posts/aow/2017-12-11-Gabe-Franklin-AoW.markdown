Nearly every athlete will tell you that they desperately want to improve, but few have the work ethic to back that statement up. However, sophomore Gabriel Franklin has put in enough hours to make that claim, and he’s now reaping the benefits. While others were relaxing in the sun, Franklin spent his spring, summer, and fall training hard with and against the best the city has to offer through his AAU team, the ProLevel Titans, and at this point the PSAL ‘A’ division probably feels slow to him. After two league games, Franklin has scored 37 points, outscoring all other underclassmen in New York City, regardless of division or league. On a night when Hunter’s shots weren’t falling, Franklin’s 20 points and 8 boards were enough to guarantee a road win against rival Stuyvesant, and his 17 points and 6 boards at home were a major part of their comeback against Bayard Rustin. Franklin has also shone in out-of-league play; he scored 15 against Millennium, and was named to the All-Tournament team at the Eastchester Holiday Hoops tournament after scoring 25 points on the weekend. Franklin’s future with the Hawks is bright, and it’s exciting to think that Hunter will have one of the most prolific scorers in the city this year and for years to come.
