Junior Sarah Kwok is the unsung hero of Girls Varsity Volleyball and a well-deserving recipient of the Athlete of the Week award. Playing as both a defensive specialist and outside hitter, she provides the passes needed to run a great offense and the kills and serves needed to win rallies. Her extreme athleticism is a huge asset to the team; her incredible reflexes and hustle on court have given the team many saves and passes that demonstrate how important back row defense is. Opponents underestimate her for her height, but she is also a smart hitter who can be relied on to get the ball over and place it to get easy kills. Her stats are evidence of her skill: Kwok racked up 33 aces, 72 service points, 45 digs and 20 kills this season alone. She wows the crowd (and her teammates) every time she plays, and never fails to be a crucial member of the team on and off the court. Kwok is an amazing athlete, and everyone should look out for her in the spring as an epee fencer, during next fallâ€™s volleyball season, or just in the courtyard practicing with her friends!
