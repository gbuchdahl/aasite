### About

I created this AA Website and personally hosted it in order to more effectively convey information to the Hunter Athletics Community. 

* Linked to a weekly video production recapping the week and promoting upcoming events
* Hosted "Senior Profiles" and "Athlete of the Week" write-ups that allowed us to highlight individual successes and give back to older members of the community
* Served as a portal to all of our social media and announcements, such as upcoming applications to be on the board

### Tech Stack

This was the first website I ever created that wasn't just following a tutorial. I intended for the stack to be usable for everyone, including those without technical experience, so I wanted to process markdown files and display them. Jekyll was the engine I used for this, also becuase it made hosting on GitHub Pages extremely easy. I also wanted it to be accessible on mobile, as students are often accessing sites from their phones. Bootstrap made this easier.
