At the Briarcliff Invitational Tournament on Saturday, September 9th, junior captain Molly Gottesman performed exceptionally and was named one of the two All-Tournament MVPs for the team. Gottesman dominates the defense in the libero position, reading hits with ease, giving perfect passes on free balls, taking the initiative to set out of system balls, and serving to strategic spots on court. As captain, Gottesman is an indispensable source of leadership, support and motivation for her teammates, communicating a lot to her fellow teammates on and off the court and always giving insightful advice. Gottesman works seamlessly with her many other talented teammates, including seniors Chelsea Chen and Alice Lin, as well as powerhouse juniors and outside hitters Samantha Fong and Sarah Kwok. The Hawks are looking good so far this season and are sure to build on past successes the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for updates!
