It was quite the week for the Boys’ Varsity Badminton’s favorite duo. Oung Kant (12)  and Ricky Lee (11), together the Shuttlehawks’ first doubles team, kept Hunter competitive during the playoffs, fighting hard until the last point. On Thursday, coming after a heartbreaking loss to Bronx Science on Monday, the pair came from behind to exact revenge in the first round of the playoffs. They lost the first set 14-21, but rebounded with victories of 21-19 and 21-13 in the second and third sets to defeat the same Bronx Science doubles team that had beaten them twice this season. Their win was crucial: it helped clinch the quarterfinals win for the Shuttlehawks and propel them towards Friday’s semifinals match against Brooklyn Tech. Kant and Lee then dominated again, winning their match 2-0 (21-14 and 21-9) with ease. Sadly, their efforts were not enough, as Brooklyn Tech, the team seeded highest in the city, beat Hunter 3-2 to eliminate the Shuttlehawks from playoff contention. Kant graduates in the spring and the pair will be split up, but they will always remember how hard they battled to win.
