Brendan Sullivan, one of the Captains of Hunter’s Boys’ Varsity Basketball team, has been an integral part of Hunter’s program since middle school. From then until now, coaches from Audie Villot to John Valinotti to Neil Potter have all been able to rely on him to hustle, get rebounds, and provide a robust defensive presence in the paint. Sullivan, after working extremely hard in the offseason, secured a relatively regular spot in Potter’s starting lineup and has been a big part of this season’s success. Today, the Athletic Association sat down with him to discuss his time on the team.


**Athletic Association: How did you first become a part of Hunter basketball?**

Brendan Sullivan: I’ve played basketball at Hunter my whole time here, starting from when I tried out in 7th grade. My sophomore year I was selected to join Varsity’s illustrious floor squad, and I’ve been on the team ever since.

**AA: How have you developed as a player since you started being a part of the Hunter Basketball program?**
BS: I’ve mainly been an inside center my whole career but I’ve earned bronze and silver badges in several areas, such as widemaking.

**AA: How has playing Basketball shaped you off the court?**
BS: I think playing basketball has taught me the value of hard work and passion and really demonstrated to me. how those things can help you achieve success. I’ve also made lots of friends through basketball, as the team is really close.

**AA: What, in your mind, are some of the biggest differences between this year’s team and last years?**
BS: I think last year the team collectively cared less about the season and basketball in general.  The way we worked hard in the summer to ensure this season would be better demonstrates the increased passion and effort.

**AA: What’s your most memorable moment from your time on the basketball team?**
BS: So far this year we’ve had great team wins against ElRo and pigeon gang.  Hopefully the best memories will come at the end of this year.
