Congratulations to Girls’ Varsity Cross Country for a stellar season of training and racing in the beautiful fall foliage of Van Cortlandt Park. The girls began preparing for the season early in the summer, and their months of hard work paid off in the form of a 2nd place finish at the Manhattan Borough Championships on October 28th. The runners carried their success to the City Championships, where every single competitor ran a personal best for the season. This cross-country season was particularly notable because of the success of the highly talented freshman class. A core group of five dedicated freshman girls--Katherine Griem, Sophie Cooper, Reema Demopoulos, Emma Alatzas, and Rachel Friedland--brought home the gold both at the Manhattan Freshman Championship, the Freshman City Championship, and the Mayor’s Cup City Championship, making them the indisputable best freshman team in New York City. Other impressive athletes this season included junior Bella Faber-Rico, senior Kevia McComb, and senior newcomer Kiara Carloni, who proved to be a powerhouse competitor. Each athlete dropped in times throughout the season, culminating in a scorching 21:20 5k time for Griem, the team leader at the season’s end. Under the leadership of beloved head coach Howard Adams and enthusiastic captain McComb, the girls are already hard at work in preparation for their next opportunity for greatness: Indoor Track and Field.
