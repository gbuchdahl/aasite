##### Girls’ Varsity Indoor Track

Senior Kalley Huang is off to another fantastic start on the Girls’ Varsity Indoor Track team. She came in second place in the 55-meter hurdles at the Jim McKay Invitational earlier this month before setting a personal record in the event with a time of 10.69 last Friday at Night at the Sprints. Beyond her own impressive achievements as a sprinter and hurdler, Huang is a much-beloved leader on the team whose legacy will remain long after she graduates. The Athletic Association sat down with Huang to discuss her memories from her time on Hunter athletics and her aspiration for the rest of her last year of track.

**Athletic Association: When did you first join track, and why?**

**Kalley Huang:** I first joined track in eighth grade and have been doing it since! I knew I wanted to join a sport, and I didn’t have any type of technical training or coordination, so I joined track!

**AA: What is the most important lesson that you have learned from track?**

**KH:** Track has taught me a lot about myself; it’s a sport where my real competitor is myself. Coach Adams often says track is 85% mental, and I think he’s right. So much about competing is being in the right mental space and not too in my head: being ready before the race, being focused throughout the race, and being optimistic and eager to improve after the race. I’ve learned what I need to do to be competitive and confident, and it’s a really valuable lesson that extends well beyond track. Beyond myself, I think track has taught me how to be a good leader, and I’m incredibly thankful for that lesson as well.

**AA: What is your fondest memory of Hunter athletics?**

**KH:** I think my fondest memory would have to be last year’s Manhattan borough championships—specifically the 100 meter hurdles. The hurdles are my favorite track event, and I’ve been doing them since sophomore year. It’s been a lot of hard work, especially because of nagging injury, so PRing and scoring championship points was really special.

**AA: What advice do you have for younger students thinking about joining track?**

**KH:** Do it! It’s so much fun and very, very rewarding. There’s nothing quite like the track community, and I love it and track a lot. It’s been one of the best parts of being at Hunter, and I recommend it to everyone.
