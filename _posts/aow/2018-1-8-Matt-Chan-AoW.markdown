Sophomore Matt Chan has followed up his strong freshmen season with an elite campaign this year. In Hunter’s meet against Bronx Science, Chan swam a 4 second personal record in the 200 freestyle. Chan has become prolific, scoring in all of his relays this season. Chan has been an integral part of Hunter’s lineup this season. Chan is one of the unsung heroes of this Hunter team, often lacking in them as a result of missing the 9 seniors from last season. It will be a challenge for the team to make playoffs this year, but with Chan’s help they should be able to sneak in.
