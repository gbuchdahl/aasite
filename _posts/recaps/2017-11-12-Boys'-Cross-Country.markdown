The Boys’ Varsity Cross Country wrapped up their season by qualifying for the City Championship and taking third in Manhattan during the Borough Championship.  Junior Fred Halbhuber led the pack this season, and had a particularly impressive performance at the 3rd Manhattan Grand Prix meet; he ran a 5k in 19 minutes and 16.20 seconds placing first.  Halbhuber placed 10th at the Borough Championship, improving his 5k time by 23 seconds over the course of the season, only 10 seconds slower than this year’s city champion.  We can surely expect an outstanding season next year from star trackie Halbhuber.  Junior Sean Sidi also had an exceptional 5k time at the 3rd Manhattan Grand Prix meet, where he placed 6th.  There were many breakthrough performances this past season by sophomores and freshmen.   Sophomore Kyle Duran is keeping the Hawks hopeful for the future.  Duran placed third in both the Manhattan Freshman Sophomore Borough Championships and the Grand Prix /#2 meet.  Freshmen Nikhil Friedman and Elijah Suh both really stepped up and ran at varsity levels throughout the season.  Although Seniors Thomas Benson and Jake Singer are graduating this year, the team will be left in good hands.    It was an excellent season for the Hawks and they are determined to come back even stronger next season to claim their rightful place as first in Manhattan!
