##### Girls’ Varsity Cross Country

Senior Kiara Carloni, the heart and soul of the Girls’ Varsity Cross Country team, has had an amazing fall season. She came in fifth place at Borough Championships last month with an extraordinary 5K time of 22:20, before beating that time at City Championships last weekend with a time of 21:40. Carloni is a truly dedicated member of the team, and is looking forward to the indoor track season.

**Athletic Association: Why did you first join track?**

**Kiara Carloni:** I joined track December of last year, when I was a junior. The immediate reason was because my close friend joined so I knew that would be one of my few chances to be new alongside someone else. I’d already wanted to join track, however, because I wanted to get into better shape and because I’d liked running on my own since freshman year. I also wanted to work on getting out of my comfort zone and pursuing the things I’m interested in regardless of the foreseen difficulties.

**AA: What is your most memorable experience from your time in Hunter athletics?**

**KC:** I’ve had a lot of really positive experiences in Hunter athletics, but one of the best would have to be warming up with my 4 by 8 team at one of the smaller outdoor meets last year. Although I distinctly remember my terror and nervousness about the upcoming meet, I also remember feeling very grateful for the opportunity to meet and run alongside some incredible athletes and funny, warm people.

**AA: What advice do you have for younger Hunterites thinking of joining a sport?**

**KC:** If I had a chance to speak to my younger self, I would probably tell her to have no fear about what other people on the team would think about you or how good you would be. By the time you’re a senior, you’ll have forgotten all the embarrassing moments, anyway. And it’s definitely worth it — the nicest thing about Hunter athletics, throughout my experience on all the teams, is the feeling of community that transcends the strict limits of the sport or personal ability. Also, if you’re not sure of which sport to try, pick track! Joining the team has been one of the highlights of my time at Hunter, and we’ll definitely be happy to have you.

**AA: What athletic accomplishment are you most proud of?**

**KC:** I can’t really pick out any particular drop in time or place as the best. While every achievement is nice individually, I’m proudest of myself for learning to have the mentality to be continually committed to improving overall, specifically by pushing myself to do extra work outside of the strict requirements of practice. That’s definitely not something I had when I was a seventh or eighth grader on the middle school volleyball team, but if I can keep it up going forward I definitely think I’ll be a happier and more productive person.

**AA: What is the most important lesson that you have learned from Coach Adams?**

**KC:** Getting to know Coach has definitely been one of my highlights of the track team – he constantly impresses me with his dedication, optimistic outlook, and sarcasm. The trait I most admire in him, however, is his ability to be cool and get along with everyone. Coach seems to know everyone’s name, whether we’re at Hunter at 6 am waiting to leave for a track meet, at Van Cortlandt Park watching people set up a meet, or at the Armory trying to pick up racing shoes for the team after practice. Coach Adams is always distinctly aware of the effect his words would have on others at any given moment, and I really admire his consideration.
