### About

I created the first ever Athletic Association Website for my high school. I took it upon myself to personally host it, with the mission of more effectively conveying information to the Hunter Athletics Community. 

Some of the ways I added value: 
* Linked to a weekly video production recapping the week and promoting upcoming events
* Hosted "Senior Profiles" and "Athlete of the Week" write-ups that allowed us to highlight individual successes and give back to older members of the community
* Served as a portal to all of our social media and announcements, such as upcoming applications to be on the board

### Tech Stack

This was the first website I have ever made, so it is certainly a little messy, but a learning process.

I intended for everyone to be able to write articles for the site, including people without technical experience, so a markdown engine made sense. Jekyll was the templating engine I used for this, also becuase it made hosting on GitHub Pages extremely easy. 

I also wanted the site to be accessible on mobile, as students are often accessing the web from their phones. Bootstrap made styling this much easier.
