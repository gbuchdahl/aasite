Finishing the 2017 season ranked seventh in the city, the Hunter Duckies had another great year of competition. Coaches Robert Gaudenzi and Michael Bardo, alongside captains Helen Lu (12), Sabrina Reguyal (12), Prithi Chakrapani(12), and Samantha Juang (11), intensified this season’s training regime and lineup strategies, and it paid off. The team had many amazing individual and team performances. Catherine Fan (10) ended the season having qualified for states in two events and placing second in the city in the 100 Backstroke and the 200 IM. Maya Milrod(10) placed third in the city in the 500 Freestyle and Hunter’s 400 Free Relay consisting of Fan, Milrod, Kiely Yeh (9), and Ailsa Craven(10) finished fourth in the city. The Duckies finished third in the Manhattan/Bronx Division with a 6-4 record. While the Duckies most definitely improved from last year, it was not enough to beat their long-time rivals Bronx Science and Stuyvesant. Despite this, the team is very proud of their competitive results this year. The Duckies continue to inch closer to beating Stuyvesant and Bronx Science and had an impressive showing in their first rounds of playoffs where they beat Staten Island Tech 61-37. Alongside amazing swimming performances, the team’s sole diver Elizabeth Prishchepova (11) had a great season, securing much needed points against Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, and Bronx Science. Coaches Gaudenzi and Bardo, along with an excellent lineup of managers, further optimized the team’s success. Overall, the Duckies had a great season, maintaining their prestige within the PSAL and previewing their potential for upcoming seasons.
