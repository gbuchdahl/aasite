Girls’ Varsity Golf  had a historic season: fantastic finishes at the Individual Championships and their second consecutive New York City Championship win against rival team Tottenville. These accomplishments would not be possible without the  leadership and skill of junior captain Lizzy Wagman. Not only has Wagman remained undefeated in match play for two years in a row, but she has also proven herself as a force to be reckoned with as an individual golfer, placing 2nd in the city in individuals in 2016 as well as in 2017. She has proven herself to be an excellent leader both on and off the course, mentoring younger players on both the physical and psychological aspects of the game. After giving many chipping, putting, and range lessons to the younger players on the team, Wagman and fellow senior captain Rebecca Chan have formed a successful team of golfers with amazing capabilities. In addition, Wagman plays on the Co-ed Golf team, and adds valuable points to contribute to their wins. Next year, Wagman will lead Girls’ Varsity Golf in the #1 spot to another successful season!
