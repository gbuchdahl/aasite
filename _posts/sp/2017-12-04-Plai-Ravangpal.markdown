##### Boys’ Varsity Wrestling

Senior Plai Ravangpal is the new comeback kid. After a year away from the team, he has returned to the wrestling team for his last year at Hunter. Ravangpal first joined the team in his sophomore year, and after a year apart, is looking to make his mark and make this season a memorable one.

**Athletic Association: What made you decide to join the wrestling team in 10th grade?**

**Plai Ravangpal:** I decided it was time I put my (short-lived) track career to an end. So following the end of the cross country season I was looking for a new sport. The two that were advertised to me were swimming and wrestling. I decided to try each one out and make my decision. After one action-packed practice at 7 am of swimming back and forth for an hour, I decided I did not want to do track and field but in water and also at 7 am.

**AA: What made you decide to come back this year after not wrestling last year?**

**PR:** I did wrestling for probably a month last year, but then quit because the junior year grind was too rough. I actually wasn’t planning on joining wrestling this year because I made the conscious decision that the life of a student athlete was not for me. But as I stumbled upon the first wrestling practice of the season, basically by accident, the memories of the hours spent in that alcove came back to me.

**AA: What is the toughest part of wrestling for you?**

**PR:** Each match is a maximum of 6 minutes, but it is the hardest, most strenuous 6 minutes of your life. While wrestling is a very technical sport, it is also just a match of who can continue to struggle for the longest amount of time. I would always use to think, “Oh I’m in a bad position, I guess I’ve just lost.” But once you’re in that bad position, you gotta go Super Saiyan and keep grunting until you get out.


**AA: What has been the most enjoyable part of being on the team? Favorite memory?**

**PR:** We’re a small team but very close knit. Practice consists of us pushing ourselves to the limit and then beating each other up. The end of each practice is a victory because we survived the literal beating that we give to each other, and it brings us closer together. My favorite memory is from one of my first matches in sophomore year: the other guy and I essentially immediately started slapping each other’s faces as soon as the match started until the referee blew the whistle and told us to stop.

**AA: What is the environment like in a typical practice?**

**PR:** Like I said previously, we’re all pushing ourselves to the limit because that’s what wrestling is all about. But it’s this mutual suffering that causes us to push each other as a team and pick others up. There’s always at least some fun time though as we pause near the end to play dodgeball and other games.

**AA: What is your funniest story from wrestling?**

**PR:** Fahim getting dragged across the mat by the legs during a match so he could be more conveniently pinned.
