##### Boys' Varsity Wrestling

Senior Alex Kofman has been on wrestling at Hunter for as long as he has been at Hunter. The current varsity co-captain joined the Hunter Middle School wrestling team in 7th grade and has been wrestling at a high level ever since. Last year, he finished 3rd at the PSAL Manhattan Borough Championships. This year he was ranked 13th in the PSAL in his weight class of 160 pounds. He is a major contender for Boros and potentially Cities this year and looks to make a major impression in his last season.

**AA: How did you find and why did the you join the wrestling team in 7th grade?**

AK:  I was tired of sitting on the bench on the MS soccer team (sorry Jason!), and I saw a poster advertising wrestling so I gave it a try just to see how it would go. It think it’s gone pretty well!

**AA: What is your most memorable story from wrestling?**

AK: The most memorable story for me was at the freshman-sophomore tournament at the end of my first varsity season. It was also the turning point in my wrestling career. For the first time that season, I actually did well at the tournament and won some matches before losing one and dropping down to the consolation bracket. I won all the next ones and in my fifth match of the day, I was wrestling for third place. Although my opponent comprehensively beat me, I did not allow him to pin me or build a 15-point lead to trigger the mercy rule, lasting the entire six minutes. Though I didn’t win the medal there, my performance at the tournament built my confidence and allowed me to come back for a very successful sophomore year.

**AA: Are you a fan of the new uniform or still team singlet?**

AK: Believe it or not, the singlet is actually much better to wrestle in because of the way the new uniform pants sit on the hips and because there’s less material for the opponent to grab onto. However, singlets have a lot of stigma associated with them, and allowing people the option to not wear one should remove one of the major obstacles to recruiting new wrestlers. Also, the new uniform looks pretty cool!

**AA: What is your funniest story from wrestling?**

AK: At a tournament last year, one of my teammates was wrestling and everyone else was sitting on the side of the mat yelling different and somewhat conflicting comments. Then suddenly he starts to reach behind him, which you should never do, and everyone said at the same time, “No! No! Don’t reach back!” It was the only time the whole match that everyone was giving the same advice.

**AA: What is toughest part of wrestling?**

AK: The toughest part of wrestling is definitely sticking with the sport during the first year of varsity. I went up against juniors and seniors all the time and most matches, I would be pinned within a minute. But I stuck with the team and a few short years later, I became the person pinning people in under a minute and collecting tournament medals.

**AA: What is your go-to move and why?**

AK: My favorite takedown is the fireman’s carry! I discovered it in the preseason before my 10th grade year, and it is a big part of the reason why I did so well that season. It just clicked for me in a way that many other takedowns did not until much later. The fireman’s carry is also easier to execute than other moves against an opponent who defends their legs more, because it only requires attacking the arm and leg on the same side. It’s also an old-school move that isn’t taught very much anymore, so when opponents don’t know what to expect they find it very disorienting.
