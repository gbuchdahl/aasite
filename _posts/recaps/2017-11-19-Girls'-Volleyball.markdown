For yet another year, Girls Varsity Volleyball has ended their season with a bang. They lost in the playoffs to #13 seed Millennium, but that doesn’t take away from the girls’ great season. This year, the team went upstate and took second in the Briarcliff Tournament against Briarcliff, won a set against #1 seed Brooklyn Tech in the Cardozo Tournament, and went undefeated yet again in the regular season.

Only four seniors are leaving the team this year, but each of them contributed greatly. Captain and starting setter Chelsea Chen was a main component of the team’s offense with a whopping 125 assists, and also a big boost to the team’s morale. Alice Lin and Shirley Liu both added to the massive amount of kills the team accumulated and brought positive energy onto the court. Additionally, sister duo Michelle Rozelman (12) and Nicole Rozelman (11) displayed great chemistry that reflected well on the rest of the team.

The large body of eight juniors each have unique attributes that all played a huge part in the Headhunters’ success. First-year captain and all-around player Samantha Fong lead the team’s offense with 46 kills, and her charisma and love for the sport was a cohesive force in the team dynamic. Co-captain and libero Molly Gottesman’s court experience helped her ace serves and make good digs, and her strong leadership kept the team focused. Sarah Kwok’s catlike reflexes and insane hustle has made her the player to watch with 45 digs and numerous impressive passes and saves. With middles Amira Purnell and Cheyenne Willis, setter Marin Silverman, pin hitter Daphne Wang and defensive specialist Anna Du all making important contributions, the team is very well-rounded.

Although there are only three sophomores on the team, they are each a force to be reckoned with. Setter Fiona Hung’s court awareness has helped her land a total of 97 serving points and 48 aces, and made her both a valuable hitter and defensive player on the right side. Middle hitter Hillary Zeng’s speed, strength and hops have made her invaluable to the team’s presence at the net with 31 kills and 17 blocks. Right side hitter Miriam Hirschhorn’s dedication to the team showed in her improvement in the offensive department in the beginning of the season and her attendance to games and practices even when she was out with an illness.

Even though the loss of four integral members of the team is saddening for this close team, the Headhunters are using their bitter loss in the playoffs as fuel to go harder than ever next year.
