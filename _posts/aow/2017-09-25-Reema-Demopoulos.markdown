Freshman powerhouse Reema Demopoulos has wowed everyone at Van Cortlandt Park thus far this season. Demopoulos honed her talents running in Hunter’s middle school program, under the expert tutelage of Coach Kenny Anderson. Despite her young age, Demopoulos has transitioned expertly to the varsity level, already proving to be one of the fastest athletes that the Hawks have seen in recent years. At the first race of the season, the Grand Prix on Tuesday, September 19th, Demopoulos took home first place with a scorching time of 11:13.6. Close behind her were Hunter’s other freshman girls — Kate Griem, Rachel Friedland, Sophie Cooper, and Emma Alatzas took home 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th respectively, giving Hunter a total sweep of the race. The group of high-performing freshmen share a special bond, encouraging and motivating each other through every practice and race. Coach Howard Adams and the older members of the team alike are excited to see where this talented squad will go, both in Varsity races and at the Freshman Borough and City Championships, coming up in October. As for Demopoulos, she only seems to be getting faster — she dropped almost half a minute in her next race, running 10:46.5 and coming in 2nd at Saturday’s PSAL Group Run. Demopoulos and her fellow talented freshmen teammates are certainly a group to keep an eye on as the season progresses and their times continue to drop. Go Hawks!
