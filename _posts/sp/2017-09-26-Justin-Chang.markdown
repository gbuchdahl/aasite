##### Co-Ed Varsity Bowling

Senior Justin Chang, a member of Co-Ed Varsity Bowling since his freshman year, is having a phenomenal season. He is averaging more than 150 pins per game, and hopes to lead the team to its first playoff victory since 2014.

**Athletic Association: When did you start getting serious about bowling, and what got you interested?  How did you find your way onto the Hunter team?**

**Justin Chang:** I spent a lot of time in bowling alleys growing up because of my dad. He ran a bowling pro shop and also a couple of amateur leagues. My sundays were consumed at a bowling tournament watching people bowl for a couple of hours. After doing this for a couple of years, I think I naturally gained an interest in the sport, but it wasn't until my freshman year that I begin to bowl myself. After I found out that Hunter even had a bowling team, I joined immediately and became part of the team only because of how small the team was. I've been practicing ever since.

**AA: Last year you posted the best average on the team. What contributed to your success the most and how did you keep your scores consistently high?**

**JC:** Bowling is a sport of practice so the only way to really get better at it is by finding a method that works for you, like your own style, and making it almost second nature.

**AA: What goals do you have this season, for the team and yourself?**

**JC:** As far as I know, our team has only been past the first round of the playoffs once before. I want to help take us to the second round one more time before I leave the school. For myself, I guess I just want to break 200 during an official game.

**AA: What would you say to people who don't think that bowling is a real sport?**

**JC:** It's understandable because bowling is usually linked with birthday parties and it doesn't seem physically demanding. However bowling is a sport that requires intense focus and consistency. The game is extremely mental in that if you begin to stress even a little bit, the entire game can be ruined. Also, bowlers have to be adaptable because, unlike other sports, the environment is not a constant. Every lane is different, even within the same alley, and every lane will change throughout the game. All of the changing variables and the precision required of bowling make it a sport to me.

**AA: Do you have a pregame routine for each of your games?**

**JC:** Nothing really unique i think. Because of how focused I have to be to perform at my best, I try to clear my head right before a match starts. Stressing too much over a game, or anything really, never helps so I usually read or listen to music for a couple of minutes to get my mind off what's about to happen. Once the match starts, though, bowling well is the only thing in my head.
