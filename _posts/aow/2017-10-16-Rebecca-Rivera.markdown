Senior and Co-Captain Rebecca Rivera led the senior girls’ Spirit Day flag football team to victory. Not only did she serve as a strong leader, organizing practices for the team and making decisions about positions and plays, but she ensured victory over the juniors by scoring a touchdown in the second half, bringing the score to 14-0. Rivera played wide receiver. Quarterback Jillian Fried (12) passed her the ball and and Rivera caught it, sprinting down the left side, dodging two juniors and clearing several yards to get the touchdown. Her contributions on and off the field allowed for the team’s win and shut-out.
