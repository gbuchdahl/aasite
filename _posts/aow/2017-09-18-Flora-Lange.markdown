Right off the bat, freshman Flora Lange has proved herself as an incredibly valuable asset to the Girls’ Varsity Soccer team. Lange was essential to the results of the team’s first three games (against LaGuardia, ICE, and Notre Dame Academy) both offensively and defensively; her scoring abilities became evident right away, and her aggression in the midfield allowed for three shutouts. Hunter faced Notre Dame Academy in a non-league game in an attempt to play a more competitive match, but came away with a 5-0 win, thanks to Lange’s early hat-trick. In her first week of her first season with the team, Lange already got into the groove of working with veterans; in additions to her own goals, she has been a playmaker, delivering assists for senior Gabriela Mernin. She dominates on the ball and when the other team has it, but still manages to find new ways to work with her teammates. Lange will undoubtedly continue to contribute heavily to the team’s success this season, and hopefully help to push for a deeper playoff run than in the 2016 season.
