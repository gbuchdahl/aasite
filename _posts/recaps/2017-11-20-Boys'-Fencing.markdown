This season was yet another dominating one for the Hawks. The team finished the season with seven fencers in the top 100 for wins and six fencers in the top 100 for touches. The Hawks were led by senior captains Sean Ma, David Godovich and William Xie. Godovich and Ma were the leaders of the foil team, as the starter and anchor. The starter fences first and is responsible for setting the tempo and getting out to a lead while the anchor, often reserved for a team’s best fencer, fences last and is responsible for closing out the win. Godovich finished the season with 79 touches and 11 wins  while Ma finished with 83 touches and 10 wins. For epee, there was a rotation of fencers at the starter position and senior William Xie usually anchored. Evan Wu (12), James Chou (12), and David Yoo (10) were among the fencers who took on the role throughout the season. George Diebel was also an integral part of the team, leading the Hawks with 110 touches and 16 wins. The season was full of individual and team success at tournaments.  Yoo finished second at the Boys’ Invitational, Nicholas Dyette (11) finished third at the Boys’ Novice tournament and Ma defeated his own teammate Godovich at the Boys’ Individual tournament for the bronze. The Hawks capped off their dominant season with a strong performance at the City Championships. Epee won 1st place, foil finished 5ht and the Hawks finished 3rd overall.
