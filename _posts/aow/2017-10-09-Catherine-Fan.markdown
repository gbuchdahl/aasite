Although the Hunter Duckies initially had a delayed start to their season due to an over chlorinated pool, they have recently returned to being a dominate force within the PSAL Bronx/Manhattan League. While there are a plethora of strong swimmers on the team, sophomore Catherine Fan stands out. Despite only being two meets into her season, Fan has already recorded two state qualifying times in the 200 Individual IM and 100 Backstroke. Her 200 IM time was well under the 2:12.83 state time at 2:11.32 seconds, and her 100 Backstroke time of 0:58.65 was also significantly below the state qualifying time of 1:00.42 seconds. Fan has also proved to be a successfully diverse swimmer, placing first in every 100 backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly event she has swam so far this season. Other than her stellar individual times, Fan has been a crucial part of Hunterâ€™s strongest relays, most notably the 200 IM Relay team which has won incontestably against Stuyvesant and Laguardia, two of the stronger teams within the division. Fan has been crucial to success that the Duckies have has so far this season and, as a sophomore, represents the successful future of the Hunter Duckies. Going forward into the season, Catherine Fan will surely continue to be a standout swimmer within the PSAL.
