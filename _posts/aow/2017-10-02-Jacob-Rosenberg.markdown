Senior Jacob “The Bald” Rosenberg propelled Co-Ed Varsity Bowling to a spectacular opening to the season this week. Rosenberg overcame a preseason concussion to make it onto the A team for Monday’s season opener against Seward Park. He got the Hawks off to an incredibly hot start, with three strikes in his first three frames. The veteran bowler finished strong as well, closing all but four frames on the day; his score of 170 helped set the tone for the Hawks’ 3-0 sweep of Seward Park, historically Hunter’s biggest rival for the Manhattan III division championship. On Tuesday, Rosenberg had another elite day, bowling a 155 and combining with Chris Aiello (11), Sam Brill (11), and Luca Washenko (12) for a 599-353 demolition of Graphics Campus’ A team. He demonstrated his immense skills in picking up spares, leaving only three open frames and acquiring five 9-1s on the day. Rosenberg’s casual leadership and years of bowling experience mean that he will keep dominating in upcoming matches against University Neighborhood, West 50th, and HSEF. For a team looking to avenge its first round loss in last year’s playoffs, he is a great asset. Expect him to lead the Hawks to success this year!
