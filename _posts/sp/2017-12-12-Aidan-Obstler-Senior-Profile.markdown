Senior Aidan Obstler has given every winter of his Hunter athletics career to basketball. As captain and scoring leader, Obstler is looking to flip the book and lead the Boysâ€™ Varsity Basketball team to a bounce back season. His dedication, heart, leadership, and love for the game are admirable and he sets a high bar for those following in his footsteps.

**Athletic Association: How did you first get involved with the Hunter basketball program?**                                          

Aidan Obstler: In 6th grade through middle school basketball, I made the team and was immediately hooked. I spent extra time working on my game with many clinics with former Coach Ido.  

**AA: What was your most memorable moment on the court with the team? Off the court?**

AO: There are lots of memorable moments with the team on and off the court. On the court I'd say our win (!) vs. Stuy last year, our win at Homecoming in 2015-2016, or the locker room after the 2016 playoff loss...just seeing the raw emotion of all the seniors on the team after their loss and how much they cared really left a lasting impact on me. Due to the fact that we are such a tight knit group, off the court there are too many to count.

**AA: Who has been your biggest inspiration or role model throughout your time with Hunter Basketball?**

AO: I've had a lot of role models throughout my time with Hunter basketball. The most important ones, I'd say, are Clyde Weems, Moises Chauncer, Caleb Yellin Flahrety, Robert Berk, Fabien Bessez, Chris Klein, Pranab Karki, and of course, the Radvany siblings. Their leadership both on and off the court has lead me to the position I am today.

**AA: This is your final year as a Hunter athlete. What lessons did you learn throughout your career? What part will you miss most?**

AO: I learned a lot about my own ability to stay committed to one thing over a long period of time, and how to be a leader. I will miss the great home crowds and all of the banter with the members of the team I've had over the years.

**AA: What does the future of Hunter Basketball look like in your opinion?**

AO: It looks good---most members of the rotation this year are juniors so we will be a great year next season for sure. Beyond that, there is tons of developing talent like Gabe Franklin in 2020. He has the potential to be one of the better point guards in Hunter history and we have tons of other sophomores and freshmen practicing with us, so it will be exciting to see how they grow into bigger roles.

**AA: Any predictions for the season?**

AO: We have been working hard all year and I think it will pay off. We will win 10 games, make the playoffs, and prove the haters wrong.
