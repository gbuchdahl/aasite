At the Boys’ Varsity Fencing City Championships this past Sunday, senior William Xie channelled the mindset of the almighty Greg Jennings and put Hunter’s epee team on his back. Hunter’s epee team won first place and Hunter earned a bronze finish overall, thanks in no small part to Xie. He won all three of his bouts against Millennium in the round of 16, two of his three bouts against Stuyvesant in the quarterfinals, won one and tied one of his three bouts against Beacon in the semifinals and against the number one seeded Brooklyn Tech in the finals carried the team with a staggering 20 touches. He was a nearly unstoppable juggernaut throughout the entire tournament ending the day with a total of 68 touches, and a bout record of 8-3-1. Xie was also the anchor for Hunter’s epee team, meaning he fenced last and against the opposition’s best fencers. Don’t let that warm, kind smile fool you, Xie is an absolute monster.
