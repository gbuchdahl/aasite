Girls’ Varsity Tennis has wrapped up a successful fall season, thanks in no small part to the efforts of seniors Sophie Edelman and Clara Lee. They play in what is consistently one of the most competitive divisions in the PSAL A, a division that contains the top 2 teams in the city in Bronx Science and Beacon and a perennial semifinalist in Stuyvesant. Even with this tough schedule, Edelman and Lee battled out 4 wins in the tough 1st doubles spot throughout the regular season. However, more recently, the team of Edelman and Lee came up huge for the Hawks. Against \#10 Seeded Leon Goldstein HS, Hunter needed great play from the second half of their lineup, and 1st doubles came up huge, winning 10-5 to secure the upset victory 3-2 in the second round of the playoffs. Unfortunately, Stuyvesant proved to be too much for the Hawks in the following round, but Edelman and Lee proved their skill again, winning that match 10-8 despite the team falling 4-1 in a long-fought, 2 day affair. Lee and Edelman were a big part of the success of this year’s Hawks team, and their leadership and skill will be missed next year.
