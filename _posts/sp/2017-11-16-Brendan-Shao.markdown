##### Boys' Varsity Badminton

Boys’ Varsity Badminton captain Brendan Shao finished off his Hunter career with an exquisite season. He went 23-6 in the regular season, dominating the division and defeating numerous strong opponents, including the Bronx Science first singles player twice! Shao’s amazing leadership stems not only from his talent but also his work ethic. He was pressed into service as the first singles player in sophomore year and he has not looked back since. The team will suffer a loss next season without Shao and his fellow seniors, but he leaves them in good hands, having taught the younger players the value of dedication and hard work.

**Athletic Association: How did you first get involved in badminton?**

**Brendan Shao:** People always say things like "love at first sight" but for badminton it was very different. My first exposure to badminton was accidently popping in on a badminton practice in my freshman year, though I didn't give much attention to it. Later that month, I would be out at a park with my friend's family and they just happened to bring along some badminton equipment. I would pick up the birdy, drop it, and try to serve it, over and over again. It wasn't much of a game, it was more like me dropping and picking up the birdy for thirty minutes. My friend finally stops me and says, "Wow, you're pretty bad at this," and we both agreed to do something else. At the end of that day however I thought to myself, "It would really fun to pick up badminton and then surprise him with how good I've gotten," and that's pretty much how I started.

**AA: What kind of pressure is put on you as the first singles player? How do you react to and deal with this pressure?**

**BS:** Unlike a lot of people, I was thrown into the first singles position from my first year of playing, with no prior experience. At that point in time, I had a lot of confidence in my skills, perhaps too much. My first season was a dominant one and with every win, it wasn't just our scores that grew, but my ego as well. During championships, we managed to make it all the way to finals against FDR, the reigning champions and when I won my game, I thought out of habit that the match was done, that we had somehow sealed the trophy. Unfortunately that wasn't the case and we lost 2-3. It was only in my junior year that I began to fully realize my responsibility as the singles 1 player. Being singles 1 meant that I had to play first and I learned that hearing that your singles 1 lost is an incredibly disheartening thing for the team. This combined with the high expectations set upon me as one of the best players in the city led to an absurd amount of pressure. If this was any other team, I'm not sure I would've been able to handle it but the badminton community is just such a positive, supportive environment and I hope I managed to keep it that way.

**AA: What is your favorite memory from your years on the team?**

**BS:**  My favorite memory of the team was at the city championship finals against FDR during my junior year. FDR was leading 2-1 and the final two games were being played out. I remember it so clearly because of how nervous I was. We were so close to that elusive first place last year, and this year it seemed only right that we would come out on top. Yet we lost another game. With the match officially over, and second place guaranteed for us, all that remained was the second doubles game. Most people, when they realize that they have already lost, would give up. From the worse to the best schools, I've seen far too often people simply throw in the towel and quit, staying on the court for mere formalities. But this match was different: Oung and Brendon played the best that I have ever seen them play before. They paid no attention to the jeers of FDR or the fact that we had already lost, but continued to persevere. That moment taught me that the championship trophy wasn't the ultimate goal. It was representing Hunter in a way that would make them proud. And to this day, I still get asked about that match from other schools and FDR themselves. I guess it was a special game for badminton history.

**AA: How do you motivate yourself to be at school on time for the early morning practices?**

**BS:**  Our practices start at 6:45am and end at 7:50am, basically the earliest of any team (except swim, I feel for them). And I'm not going to lie, there are many days when I wake up and think to myself how easy it would be to just sleep in and pretend that I was sick or something. But during those times, I remember a visit to the Stuyvesant badminton team, where I was told by several of the team members that their own captain never showed up to practice. I immediately associated that with Stuyvesant's lackluster performance every year and I'm inspired to get up, thinking how lucky I am to have such an amazing team that is willing to come almost everyday for morning practice when other schools won't even show up for their afternoon ones.

**AA: What is the best advice a coach has ever given you?**

**BS:** The only way to improve is to have confidence in yourself. The only way to have confidence in yourself is to practice. Everything starts with practice.

**AA: What is the future of the team like?**

**BS:** Although we will be losing many amazing players, there is no need for concern. Our team next year is looking just as strong and I have full faith that they will continue on the path of victory. So many of younger termers have improved so much over the past two years, and though they may not see it themselves, their efforts have not gone unnoticed.

**AA: Going off to college next year, do you have any plans to continue playing badminton?**

**BS:** I definitely want to play badminton in college. Whether or not I want to pursue it on a more competitive stage is a different issue. But we will have to see.

**AA: Any final thoughts?**

**BS:** From the very beginning, winning the championships was not the main goal for me, though it certainly was an important one. It was bringing more awareness to an amazing sport that has a bad public image. Although badminton is relatively easy to get into, it is incredibly difficult to master. A lot of people (including myself in the past) tend to pick on the fact that it seems easy but to me that's just another reason why badminton is such a great sport. After all, part of what makes watching sports so interesting is being able to play it yourself and experiencing it firsthand.
