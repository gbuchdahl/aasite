Junior Bryce Demopoulos is off to a great start this Indoor Track season, qualifying for the City Championships early on. Along with his teammate Fred Halbhuber (11), Demopoulos qualified in the 1000m race with a time of 2:46.91 at the Jim McKay Memorial Games on December 2nd, an honor that he refers to as his proudest achievement on track. Demopoulos also ran an impressive 36.68 second 300m race at the Night of the Sprints on December 8th. In addition to his success on the track, Demopoulos is a superstar road racer. Although he did not compete for Hunter this Cross Country season, he competed independently and qualified for the United States Track and Field Regional Championships in the 5k race. Demopoulos’ aspirations for the rest of the indoor season include a new Personal Record in the 800m race, meaning he will have to beat his previous PR of 2:11. Additionally, Demopoulos hopes to qualify for City Championships in the 4x800m relay with teammates Allen Weisbord (11), Peter Bilski (11), and Halbhuber. “I’m so glad to be part of a team that values competition and ability but at the same time encourages friendship and camaraderie. We’re showing a lot of promise this year, and I can’t wait to see how far we can go,” he said. Be sure to keep an eye out for Demopoulos and his teammates at upcoming meets, especially the Borough Championships on February 28th. Go Hawks!
