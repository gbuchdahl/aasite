Freshman Nikhil Friedman has had an amazing debut season on Boys’ Cross Country. Although this is Friedman’s first season of varsity sports, his young age hasn’t stopped him from standing out. Friedman’s time in the 1.5 mile race has dropped impressively over the course of the season, from 10:22 at a Grand Prix on September 19th to 9:48 less than a month later at the Manhattan Freshmen Borough Championships. Nikhil and his team of talented freshman brought home 2nd place at that championship meet, and are sure to build on that success at the Freshmen City Championships on November 4th. However, Friedman’s versatility extends beyond the freshman race; he is also an important contributor to the Hawks’ varsity contingent. Friedman came in 27th with a time of 20:34 at the Varsity Borough Championships on October 28th, helping the team to secure a 3rd place overall finish and qualifying them for the Varsity City Championships on November 11th. Aside from his personal successes, Friedman is a helpful and enthusiastic presence on the team, and his winning attitude is much appreciated by his teammates. Friedman will surely be an athlete to watch going into the two City Championships and the upcoming season of Indoor Track and Field. Go Hawks!
