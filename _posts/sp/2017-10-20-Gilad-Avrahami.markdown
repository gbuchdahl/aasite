##### Boys' Varsity Soccer

Gilad Avrahami, senior goalkeeper and captain of the Hunter Boysâ€™ Varsity Soccer team. He the team to a second round playoff game, and a 4-1 record in the 2017 season. Avrahami has been sharp all year, and all are expecting more great things to come.

**Athletic Association: When did you start getting serious about soccer? Why did you choose this sport and why did you choose to play goalkeeper?**

**Gilad Avrahami:** I started playing soccer on organized teams when I was 6, and I began to play on a travel club team five years ago. I think that was about the time that I began to devote more commitment and effort into the sport, as well as when I played goalie full-time. Most of the other players preferred to play as a field player (rather than goalie) because they would spend more time on the ball, but I liked the uniqueness and added challenges of the position. It allowed me to take a different perspective on how the game was played, and moreover, it's gratifying to be placed in the responsibility of securing the goal for the team.

**AA: How has the transition into becoming the starting keeper been? How did you prepare yourself for this while playing backup as a sophomore?**

**GA:** As a second-string goalkeeper sophomore year, the Hunter team was very supportive in granting me the playing time and respect to get accustomed to the challenges of varsity sports. I helped the starting goalkeeper warm up before each game, and I got more playing time as the year went on. The following spring and summer, I trained weekly with my dad, allowing me to feel comfortable in the starting goalkeeper slot junior year.

**AA: How do you spend the time in goal when you are not seeing a lot of action/ball is kept on offense for a while? Do you have any pre-game or in-game rituals/superstitions?**

**GA:** While the ball is up the field, my job is to watch the positioning and ball movement, and to make calls if there are weak spots either for ourselves to defend or to exploit. If the ball is in the opponent's possession towards the other end of the field, I position myself at a strategic point at the top of the penalty box in case the other team attempts to send a long ball past my defenders.

**AA: How do you deal with the pressure of the goalie position?**

**GA:** It's important to come to terms with the fact that it's easy to base the result of the game on the goalkeeper's playing, and I do often feel responsible when our team loses. The reason for this is that the goalkeeper gets relatively few plays during a game, and while a field-player's mistake can simply cause a loss of possession, a goalie's mistake often results in a goal, and can change the result of the game if the score is close. I have learned to be self-critical if I really made an avoidable error, but also tell myself that one play doesn't necessarily decide how I play for the rest of the game. One of the most difficult parts of playing goalie is still doing my best after I make a costly mistake.

**AA: What goals do you have this season, for the team and yourself?**

**GA:** I could not have been more proud of this year's squad, because they have proven that we are not limited to the mistakes of the best in our dominating win on Thursday against last year's division leader LaGuardia. I want to see our younger players to prove their abilities on the field, because many of them are very hardworking and deserve to help carry this team through a great season. We made it to the Round of 16 last year, but I believe we have the skill and passion to take our team much further. There are some really great young leaders emerging in the team, and I have faith in them to lead the team even farther in future years. In the meantime, I hope to be as good a captain as I can be this year, and for myself and this year's seniors to leave the team with a bright-looking legacy.
