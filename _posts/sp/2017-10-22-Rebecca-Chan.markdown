##### Girls’ Varsity Golf

Senior Rebecca Chan is once again dominating on the golf courses this year. She and Girls’ Varsity Golf have not lost a match since November of 2015, and look forward to repeating as city champions.

**Athletic Association: What were your thoughts before hitting the first ball off the tee at the most recent individual championships?**

**Rebecca Chan:** I knew that the tournament was mine to lose; all I had to do to secure the title was to not screw up. Sometimes I over-analyze my shots, so I tried to focus on being relaxed and just swinging the weight of the club. I also wanted to set a good rhythm for the rest of the round; it can be difficult to recover mentally once I hit a bad shot or miss a short putt.

**AA: How did you feel stepping off the last green of the tournament?**

**RC:** My group was the first to finish and the next group was almost two hours behind, so I was impatient for all of the scores to come in and to see the results. I was also annoyed with my performance because I knew that I had made several dumb decisions, costing me strokes. But all in all, I was confident that I had won because I knew that none of my competitors consistently shot in the 70s and it was unlikely that they would do so at this course.

**AA: What are your predictions for the rest of the season?**

**RC:** I’m confident that we’re going to win the city championship. At the beginning of the season, I knew that we were probably going to defend our title, but after our strong showing this week, there’s almost no way for us not to repeat.

**AA: What is the best advice a coach has ever given you?**

**RC:** My dad isn’t a coach, but before tournaments he always tells me, “If you believe, you will achieve.” The phrase is such a cliché and more often than not it falls on deaf ears, but it’s true.

**AA: Lastly, what advice would you give to less experienced Hunter golfers, or to people who are unsure of whether or not they want to play?**

**RC:** I started playing because of my brother. Watching him miss the ball was hilarious. But I think that I got to this level partly through endless competitions with him. It was boring just hitting balls, so to make practices more interesting and effective, we would devise contests to see who was superior. If you think you might be interested in golf, try hitting balls at a range or go play mini golf. I’ve never actually played mini golf, but it seems like a decent way to be introduced to the game. Also, putting is arguably the most important part of golf.
