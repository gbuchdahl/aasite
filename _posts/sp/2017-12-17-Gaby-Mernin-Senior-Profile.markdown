### Girls’ Varsity Basketball

Senior Gaby Mernin is one of Hunter’s most successful athletes. Captain of both Girls’ Varsity Soccer and Basketball, Mernin has proven her amazing skills both on and off the field. Not only has she led soccer and basketball to many victories, but she provides excellent leadership to all members of the team. With her stellar moves and born leadership, Mernin is sure to make her final year at Hunter a memorable one.

**Athletic Association:** Why did you start playing soccer and basketball?

**Gaby Mernin:**  I started playing soccer when I was about five, at the Parade Grounds a couple minutes from my house. Soccer has always been my favorite sport, but I didn’t join the Hunter team until freshman year. It was on the Hunter team that I first played the position of striker. I joined Hunter basketball in seventh grade, and although it has never been my best sport, I really enjoy playing and bonding with the team.

**AA:** What were your thoughts after the end of soccer season?

**GM:** Although I was disappointed to leave the playoffs so early, I was very proud of our team’s improvement over the course of the season. I had the pleasure of leading an enthusiastic, talented group of players, and I can’t wait to see the team’s success next year.

**AA:** What is your favorite memory of Hunter Athletics?

**GM:** My favorite memories have been made during our closest soccer games. For instance, our competitive 2-1 win against HSMSE last year was both thrilling and rewarding, particularly as a striker.

**AA:** What are your hopes for the basketball season this winter?

**GM:** This season, I hope that the team continues fighting hard in our games, both league and non-league. I want to keep our defense strong and to improve our shooting and dribbling skills.

**AA:** If you could give one piece of advice to a younger student interested in joining Hunter athletics, what would it be?

**GM:** I would absolutely encourage young Hunter students to join sports, especially soccer or basketball.  Being a member of these teams has really enhanced my Hunter experience, giving me the chance to bond with students from each grade while finding my athletic strengths.
